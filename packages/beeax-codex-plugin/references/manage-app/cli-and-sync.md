# CLI And Sync

Use this reference for BeeAX app CLI command behavior, remotes, authentication, sync, validation commands, build, deploy, logs, function execution, and CI/CD troubleshooting.

Use `../develop-app/app-structure.md` only for app file layout and post-entity-edit validation checklists.

## App Checks

Before running operational commands, confirm the current directory is a BeeAX app and inspect the active scripts and remotes:

```bash
test -f package.json
test -f src/application-config.ts
sed -n '1,220p' package.json
yarn beeax remote:list
```

Treat deploys, uninstalls, production remote changes, and production syncs as externally visible actions. Ask for explicit confirmation before running them when the target is production or user data could be affected.

## Validation Commands

Use these commands to validate an app after changes:

```bash
yarn beeax dev:typecheck
yarn lint
yarn beeax dev --once
```

`yarn beeax dev:typecheck` checks generated app types and TypeScript compatibility. `yarn lint` checks local lint rules. `yarn beeax dev --once` performs a bounded build/sync against the active remote.

If a validation command fails because of entity definitions, switch to `develop-app` for the fix. If it fails because of remotes, authentication, build tooling, sync, logs, deploys, or CI/CD, stay in `manage-app`.

## Remotes

A remote is a BeeAX server that the app can sync or deploy to. Credentials are stored locally in `~/.beeax/config.json`.

Common commands:

```bash
# Add a remote interactively.
yarn beeax remote:add

# Connect to a local BeeAX server.
yarn beeax remote:add --local

# Add a remote non-interactively.
yarn beeax remote:add --url https://your-beeax-server.com --api-key $TWENTY_API_KEY --as production

# List configured remotes.
yarn beeax remote:list

# Switch the active remote.
yarn beeax remote:use <name>
```

When the user says "prod", "production", or "workspace de prod", identify the target remote before syncing or deploying. If it is missing, add it with `--as production` or the user-provided name.

## Development Sync

Always use one-shot sync to synchronize app changes with the active remote:

```bash
yarn beeax dev --once
```

Do not use bare `yarn beeax dev` (watch mode). Run `yarn beeax dev --once` each time changes need to be synced.

One-shot sync requires an authenticated remote. If authentication fails, re-add or switch the remote before retrying.

Use verbose one-shot sync for bounded troubleshooting:

```bash
yarn beeax dev --once --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

Start by identifying which layer is failing:

- Remote/authentication.
- Dev sync or one-shot sync.
- Build/package generation.
- Deploy/upload/install.
- Runtime function execution.
- CI/CD environment or secrets.

Collect the minimum useful context before changing configuration:

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' package.json
sed -n '1,220p' src/application-config.ts
yarn beeax remote:list
yarn beeax dev --once --verbose
```

For remote or authentication issues:

- Check that the active remote is the intended workspace or server.
- Re-run `yarn beeax remote:add --local` for local app-dev servers.
- Re-run `yarn beeax remote:add --url <url> --as <name>` for remote servers.
- Avoid overwriting a production remote until the target URL is confirmed.

For sync issues:

- Prefer `yarn beeax dev --once --verbose` to get a bounded failure.
- Check generated type or schema errors before editing app entities.
- If the app depends on a changed data model, use `develop-app` to fix the entity definitions.

## Build, Deploy, Logs, And Exec

Build before deploy when the user asks for release readiness or when debugging packaging issues:

```bash
yarn beeax dev:build
```

Publish an app to npm, or publish privately to a configured BeeAX server registry:

```bash
yarn beeax app:publish
yarn beeax app:publish --private --remote production
yarn beeax app:install --remote production
```

Before deploying an update, check that `package.json` has a strictly higher semver `version` than the currently deployed version. Re-deploying the same version is rejected. After a private publish, install the deployed version with `yarn beeax app:install` when the target workspace should use it.

Use function logs when debugging runtime behavior on the connected server:

```bash
yarn beeax dev:function:logs
yarn beeax dev:function:logs -n <function-name>
```

Run a logic function manually when testing behavior without its trigger:

```bash
yarn beeax dev:function:exec -n <function-name>
yarn beeax dev:function:exec -n <function-name> -p '{"key":"value"}'
```

Uninstall only after confirmation:

```bash
yarn beeax app:uninstall
yarn beeax app:uninstall --yes
```

Integration tests install and uninstall the app on their target server, so run them against the isolated test instance (`yarn beeax docker:start --test`, port `2021`) rather than the dev instance — see `../develop-app/tests.md`.

## CI/CD

Apps generated with `create-beeax-app` can use GitHub Actions for CI and CD. For deployment automation, check the app's `.github/workflows/` files and configure:

- `TWENTY_DEPLOY_URL`
- `TWENTY_DEPLOY_API_KEY`

Do not put API keys in source files. Use the repository or CI secret store.
