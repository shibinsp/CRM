# When To Use

Pick this skill when the user wants to operate, troubleshoot, or ship an existing BeeAX app — anything between "I have an app" and "it runs in production". Representative triggers:

- "sync my app changes to the server"
- "deploy my BeeAX app to production"
- "check the logs for my logic function"
- "switch to a different BeeAX remote / instance"
- "add a new remote for staging"
- "set up CI/CD for my BeeAX app"
- "troubleshoot a failed deploy / sync / build"
- "uninstall my app from production"
- "run tests for my BeeAX app"
- "run my logic function manually for testing"

Do not use this skill to scaffold (use `create-app`), to change app entities or code (use `develop-app`), to prepare marketplace assets (use `publish-app`), or to query workspace records (use `use-beeax-mcp`).

# Boundaries

For background on how BeeAX apps work — the SDK packages, remotes, sync lifecycle, and rendering model — read `../../references/concepts/how-apps-work.md`.

Do not scaffold a new app here. Use `$create-app` when the app does not exist.

Do not add or modify app entities here. Use `$develop-app` for objects, fields, logic functions, roles, views, navigation, page layouts, skills, agents, connection providers, and front component registration.

Do not prepare marketplace README, screenshots, logos, or npm listing copy here. Use `$publish-app` for public listing work.

Do not retrieve CRM records here. Use `$use-beeax-mcp` for workspace data retrieval.

# Operating Rules

First confirm the current directory is a BeeAX app:

```bash
test -f package.json
test -f src/application-config.ts
```

Inspect current app and scripts before running operational commands:

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' package.json
yarn beeax remote:list
```

Treat deploys, uninstalls, production remote changes, and production syncs as externally visible actions. Ask for explicit confirmation before running them when the target is production or user data could be affected.

For command details, remotes, validation command semantics, sync modes, troubleshooting, build, deploy, logs, exec, and CI/CD, read `../../references/manage-app/cli-and-sync.md`.

If the user asks to run tests, also read `../../references/develop-app/tests.md` before running any test command. Full test suites include integration tests that install and uninstall the app on their target server, so start or verify the isolated test instance and run:

```bash
yarn beeax docker:start --test
TWENTY_API_URL=http://localhost:2021 yarn test
```

Do not run integration tests against the dev instance on `http://localhost:2020` unless the user explicitly asks for that target. If the user asks for unit tests only, use the package's unit-test script and no `TWENTY_API_URL` override is needed.

# Remotes

A remote is a BeeAX server that the app can sync or deploy to. Credentials are stored locally in `~/.beeax/config.json`.

Common commands:

```bash
# Add a remote interactively.
yarn beeax remote:add

# Connect to a local BeeAX server.
yarn beeax remote:add --local

# Add a remote non-interactively.
yarn beeax remote:add --url https://your-beeax-server.com --api-key $TWENTY_API_KEY --as production

# List configured remotes.
yarn beeax remote:list

# Switch the active remote.
yarn beeax remote:use <name>
```

When the user says "prod", "production", or "workspace de prod", identify the target remote before syncing or deploying. If it is missing, add it with `--as production` or the user-provided name.

# Development Sync

Always use one-shot sync to synchronize app changes with the active remote:

```bash
yarn beeax dev --once
```

Do not use bare `yarn beeax dev` (watch mode). Run `yarn beeax dev --once` each time changes need to be synced.

One-shot sync requires an authenticated remote. If authentication fails, re-add or switch the remote before retrying.

# Troubleshooting

Start by identifying which layer is failing:

- Remote/authentication.
- Dev sync or one-shot sync.
- Build/package generation.
- Deploy/upload/install.
- Runtime function execution.
- CI/CD environment or secrets.

Collect the minimum useful context before changing configuration:

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' package.json
sed -n '1,220p' src/application-config.ts
yarn beeax remote:list
yarn beeax dev --once --verbose
```

For remote or authentication issues:

- Check that the active remote is the intended workspace or server.
- Re-run `yarn beeax remote:add --local` for local app-dev servers.
- Re-run `yarn beeax remote:add --url <url> --as <name>` for remote servers.
- Avoid overwriting a production remote until the target URL is confirmed.

For sync issues:

- Prefer `yarn beeax dev --once --verbose` to get a bounded failure.
- Check generated type or schema errors before editing app entities.
- If the app depends on a changed data model, use `$develop-app` to fix the entity definitions.

For build or deploy issues:

- Run `yarn beeax dev:build` before `yarn beeax app:publish --private` or `yarn beeax app:publish`.
- Check `package.json` version when updating an already deployed app.
- Confirm the target with `yarn beeax app:publish --private --remote <name>` instead of relying on the active remote when production is involved.

For runtime behavior:

- Use `yarn beeax dev:function:logs` to inspect function execution logs.
- Use `yarn beeax dev:function:exec -n <function-name> -p '<json>'` to reproduce a logic function with a controlled payload.

For CI/CD failures:

- Check `.github/workflows/`.
- Confirm `TWENTY_DEPLOY_URL` points to a reachable server from the runner.
- Confirm `TWENTY_DEPLOY_API_KEY` is configured as a secret, not committed in source.

# Build And Deploy

Build before deploy when the user asks for release readiness or when debugging packaging issues:

```bash
yarn beeax dev:build
```

Publish an app to npm, or publish privately to a configured BeeAX server registry:

```bash
yarn beeax app:publish
yarn beeax app:publish --private --remote production
yarn beeax app:install --remote production
```

Before deploying an update, check that `package.json` has a strictly higher semver `version` than the currently deployed version. Re-deploying the same version is rejected. After a private publish, install the deployed version with `yarn beeax app:install` when the target workspace should use it.

Use `$publish-app` instead when the user wants npm marketplace publishing, listing copy, screenshots, or public app store metadata.

# Logs, Exec, And Cleanup

Use function logs when debugging runtime behavior on the connected server:

```bash
yarn beeax dev:function:logs
yarn beeax dev:function:logs -n <function-name>
```

Run a logic function manually when testing behavior without its trigger:

```bash
yarn beeax dev:function:exec -n <function-name>
yarn beeax dev:function:exec -n <function-name> -p '{"key":"value"}'
```

Uninstall only after confirmation:

```bash
yarn beeax app:uninstall
yarn beeax app:uninstall --yes
```

# CI/CD

Apps generated with `create-beeax-app` can use GitHub Actions for CI and CD. For deployment automation, check the app's `.github/workflows/` files and configure:

- `TWENTY_DEPLOY_URL`
- `TWENTY_DEPLOY_API_KEY`

Do not put API keys in source files. Use the repository or CI secret store.
